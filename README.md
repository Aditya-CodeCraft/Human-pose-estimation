# Human-pose-estimation
<br>
Overview : <br>
This project focuses on developing a robust human pose estimation system using the MediaPipe framework. The motivation behind this initiative came from observing individuals performing exercises incorrectly at the gym due to the lack of affordable trainers. This often results in increased risk of injuries and reduced workout effectiveness.
<br>
Beyond fitness, human pose estimation has applications in healthcare, sports analytics, security, and interactive applications such as gaming and virtual reality. Accurate pose estimation can aid patient monitoring, rehabilitation, performance analysis, injury prevention, and ensure better safety and user experiences.
